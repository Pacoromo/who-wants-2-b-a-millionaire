# Who wants to be a millionaire game!

## Description: 
Who Wants to Be a Millionaire is an app that behaves just like the television show on which it is based off of.
The player will have to answer multiple questions that increase in difficulty and dollar value.

* There's a total of 15 questions
* There are three groups of questions (Easy, Medium, and Hard)
* Questions are timed based on the difficulty on the question
* Questions 1-5 are 15 seconds, 6-10 are 30 seconds, and 11-15 are 45 seconds
* There are three threshholds during the game which guarantee you an amount depending on the level ($1000 and $32,000)
* If you answer a question correctly, you have the option to walk away with that amount at any time
* At the end of the game, you have the option restart a new game (with the same username) or a new game with a different player
